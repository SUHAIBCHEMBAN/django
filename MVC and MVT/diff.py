Key Differences:
View in MVC vs. MVT: In MVC, the View handles both displaying the data and user interaction. In Django's MVT, the View handles only business logic, while the Template handles the actual presentation.
Controller in MVC vs. MVT: In Django, the Controller part is more abstract and is handled by the framework itself, which maps URLs to Views.


Conclusion:
Both MVC and MVT aim to separate concerns within a web application, making it easier to manage and scale. Django's MVT pattern is a specialized version tailored for web development in Python, streamlining many common tasks with built-in tools and features.
