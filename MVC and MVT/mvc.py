MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern
Explanation:

Model: Represents the data structure and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database, retrieves, and manipulates data.
View: Represents the user interface and presentation layer. It displays the data from the model to the user and sends user commands to the controller.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it (often updating the Model), and returns the output display to the View.
Example:

In a simple web application, the Model would handle the database queries, the View would render HTML templates, and the Controller would process user inputs like form submissions.
